# An idea for the decorator pattern

What always confused me at first when I learned the decorator pattern was
why do we need a "component" class when we could just have multiple "wrapper" classes?

# Solution - cleaner (less classes to deal with/can be more intuitive) but messier (violates single responsibility principle)
TBD

# Formal definition
TBD
